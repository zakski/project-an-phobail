# Project-An-Phobail

A repository for all shared/common Scala code that somehow always makes it into all my other projects.

The Naming Convention of these projects comes from a loose english to irish translation of a word, in this case its the word 'public'.

## IO
The io packages are aimed simplifying the reading, writing and finding of files. Tests are not supplied for these classes, due there being no ironclad 
guarantees of any test files existing.

## Lang
The lang portion of the project is designed to provide all the helpful string manipulation code i reuse throughout my projects, such as capitalisation of words.

## Net
The .net packages will contain various components that are not just useful when interacting with the web specifically, but also for representing the web in a
more local manner, e.g. the providence of data sources.
